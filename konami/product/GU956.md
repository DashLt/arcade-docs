## Overview

A dedicated box with a Konami logo, an 2x16 segment LCD display, and "SET" and "MENU" buttons on the front, and power input, cab wiring, and a Konami label on the back. The label says:

Hooks up to via a serial DE-9 connector to an [NTT DoComo DoPa Mobile Ark 9601P](https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/binary/pdf/corporate/technology/rd/technical_journal/bn/vol7_3/vol7_3_019jp.pdf), a cellular modem for [DoPa](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoPa) over [PDC](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC): a Japanese 2G standard.

The power input is directly split from the cabinet's AC inlet through a standard 12V power supply, and through an additional connector (CN2 on the sub board) it sits in between the AC inlet and the rest of the cabinet internals, before even the net filter. It would seem that this gives it the possibility to deny AC input to the cabinet. It powers the NTT modem directly.

When turned on, the screen displays the selected period and the selected counter name and value, e.g. "This Month" "00/11 PT0=000000".
The available periods are:

- This Month
- Last Month
- Before Last

The available counters are "PT0", "PT1", ..., "PT9".

Pressing "Set" repeatedly cycles through the counters, while pressing "Menu" switches it into a different screen: a menu displaying what it believes to be the current date and time, and the current period, e.g. "00/01/01 00:01" "Before Last". Pressing "Set" repeatedly cycles through the periods, and pressing "Menu" returns to the first screen with the selected period.

It is spliced into the cabinet's main wiring harness through a harness from CN3 and CN4 on the main board, seemingly connecting up to 16 cables. This harness is presumably hooked up to at least the coin, service button and test button signals. It was found spliced into 6 cables, presumably at least the coin, service button, and test button signals.
