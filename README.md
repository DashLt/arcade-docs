# arcade documentation

An open (to read and contribute) repository of arcade hardware and software documentation,
started from consolidating the various text files on my drives.

## Sources

Due to the origin of this repository, there is almost no information of the sources of the information contained within it right now.
We're fairly certain on the accuracy of most of it, however do not take it as gospel and always measure before working on hardware!

A better source tagging system is in the works, and in the meantime here are some major sources used:

* First-hand accounts, observations and research;
* Manuals and other official documentation;
* Photos from various sites, most notably [Yahoo! Auctions / ヤフオク!](https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) and [eBay](https://ebay.com);
* Direct conversations with trusted sources;
* [MAME](https://git.redump.net/mame/)'s inimitable documentation;
* [Callus Next's arcade board game information](http://callusnext.com/pcbs/);
* [Guru's rom dumping news](https://members.iinet.net.au/~lantra9jp1_nbn/gurudumps/);
* The [Redump database](http://redump.org/);
* Direct conversations with other sources;

Notable sources that are often incorrect and should not be solely relied upon:

* [System16](https://www.system16.com/)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) (yes, Japanese Wikipedia too!) and its million scrapers, clones and mirrors
